## Exploratory Data Analysis
plot(ts1, type = "l")
plot(ts2, type = 'l')
```

What do you notice? Are any transformations needed?

```{r}
ts2 = ts2 + abs(min(ts2)+.01)
ts2.ln <- log(ts2)
ts2.sq <- sqrt(ts2)

t = 1: length(ts2)

lm.ts2 <- lm(ts2~t+I(t^2)+I(t^3))
ts2.lm <- ts2 - lm.ts2$fitted.values


ts2.d <- diff(ts2.ln)
acf(ts2.d, lag.max = 100)
pacf(ts2.d, lag.max = 100)

para <- c(0.5/104, rep(1/104,103),0.5/104)
fil <- stats::filter(ts2,para)
plot(t, ts2, type = "l")
points(t, fil, type = "l", col = "red")

ts.2 <- ts2[53:473]
ts2.res <- ts.2-fil[53:473]
ts2.res %>% plot()

t.2 <- 1:length(ts.2)
f1 = 1
d = 52
v1 = cos(2*pi*f1*t.2/d)
v2 = sin(2*pi*f1*t.2/d)
lin.mod = lm(ts2.res ~ v1 + v2)
ts.2.res <- ts2.res- lin.mod$fitted.values
```




Parametric fitting

```{r}
f1 = 1
f2 = 2
f3 = 3
d = 18
v1 = cos(2*pi*f1*t/d)
v2 = sin(2*pi*f1*t/d)
v3 = cos(2*pi*f2*t/d)
v4 = sin(2*pi*f2*t/d)
v5 = cos(2*pi*f3*t/d)
v6 = sin(2*pi*f3*t/d)
lin.mod = lm(ts2 ~ v1 + v2 + v3 + v4 + v5 + v6)
t = 1: length(ts2); tt = t^2 ; t3 = t^3
cub.model = lm(lin.mod$residuals ~ 1 + t + tt + t^3)
plot(t, lin.mod$residuals, type = "o", xlab = "Weekly Time", ylab = "ts2",main = "Trend Fit")
points(t, quad.model$fitted, type = "l", col = "red")
plot(t, ts2, type = "o", xlab = "Weekly Time", ylab = "ts2", main = "Trend and Seasonality")
points(t, cub.model$fitted + lin.mod$fitted, type = "l", col = "red")

```


## Model Fitting 

```{r}
ts2.m1 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 1), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52))
m1
tsdiag(m1)
```

The Ljung-Box test suggests this might not be a good fit.

Let's try other models and compare AIC values.

```{r}
m12 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 1), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 2), period = 52))
m12 # AIC(m12) = -1412.3
m21 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 2), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52))
m21 # AIC(m21) = -1427.5 
m22 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 2), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 2), period = 52))
m22 # AIC(m22) = -1426.4
```

Which model should we choose based on AIC values?

Let's try overfitting for diagnostics. There are four parameters to overfit (p,q,P,Q).
Below are the five models I found plausible but note that I also tried other models such as 
`arima(ts.log, order = c(1, 1, 2), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52))`, etc...

```{r}
m1 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 1), 
            seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52)) 
m2 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 2), 
            seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52))
m3 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 3), 
            seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52))
m4 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 4), 
            seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52))
m5 <- arima(ts.log, order = c(0, 1, 5), 
            seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 52))
```


```{r}
tsdiag(m1)
tsdiag(m2)
tsdiag(m3) 
tsdiag(m4) 
tsdiag(m5) 
```


What do we notice?
-diagnostic plots look better for more complex models
-however, we have to be wary of overfitting

How can we check for this?
-AIC and BIC values


```{r}
AIC(m1)
AIC(m2)
AIC(m3) 
AIC(m4)
AIC(m5) 

BIC(m1)
BIC(m2)
BIC(m3) 
BIC(m4)
BIC(m5)
```


Which model does AIC and BIC suggest is best?

## Cross Validation

Another method of model diagnostics is cross-validation. We break up the data into two parts: the train dataset and the test dataset. We fit models to the train dataset, and check whether it's a good model by computing the MSE of predictions for the test dataset. 

We write a function to carry out cross-validation and calculate MSE of predictions for your test dataset. Here, for each model, we find the MSE of prediction for the last five periods of the dataset. 

```{r}
mse <- function(v1,v2,tsd,n){
  n1list <- round(seq(from = ceiling(n/2), to = n-1, length.out = 30))
  test.error <- numeric(length(n1list))
  for(i in 1:length(n1list)){
    n1 <- n1list[i]
    train <- tsd[1:n1]
    test <- tsd[(n1+1):n]
    train.arima <- arima(train, order = v1, 
            seasonal = list(order = v2, period = 52)) 
    test.pred <- forecast(train.arima,length(test))$mean
    test.error[i] <- sqrt(sum((test.pred-test)^2))
  }
  return(mean(test.error))
}

v10 <- c(1,0,0)
v01 <- c(0,0,1)
v11 <- c(1,0,1)
mse (v10,c(0,0,0),ts.2.res,length(ts.2.res)) 
mse (v01,c(0,0,0),ts.2.res,length(ts.2.res))
mse (v11,c(0,0,0),ts.2.res,length(ts.2.res))##
mse(c(1,1,1),c(0,0,0),ts.2.res,length(ts.2.res))
mse(c(1,1,6),c(0,0,0))
full.arima <- arima(ts.2.res, order = v11)

```

Looking at the last period, which model is best?
Looking instead at periods 1 and 2, which model is best?

We choose model 1 for its simplicity. 

Also, not included here, but you may also want to consider removing outliers before fitting your final model.

## Forecasting

```{r}
predictions <- predict(m1, n.ahead = 104)$pred
```

We can plot our predictions to see if they make sense.

```{r}
plot(1:(length(ts) + length(predictions)), c(ts, predictions), type = 'l', col = 1)
points((length(ts) + 1) : (length(ts) + length(predictions)), 
       predictions, type = 'l', col = 2)
```


What did we forget?

```{r}
predictions <- exp(predict(m1, n.ahead = 104)$pred)
plot(1:(length(ts) + length(predictions)), c(ts, predictions), type = 'l', col = 1)
points((length(ts) + 1) : (length(ts) + length(predictions)), predictions, type = 'l', col = 2)
```

## Creating the Submission File

```{r}
write.table(predictions,
            sep = ",",
            col.names = FALSE,
            row.names = FALSE,
            file = "Example_Firstname_Lastname_StudentIDNumber.txt")

```

This should save the file to your local directory. As a check to make sure it works, we can read in the file and plot the points to make sure it is what we expected.

```{r}
temp <- read.table("Example_Firstname_Lastname_StudentIDNumber.txt", sep = ",")
plot(as.numeric(unlist(temp)))
```
