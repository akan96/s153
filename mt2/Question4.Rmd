1. Explore
```{r}
plot(ts4, type = 'l')
```


```{r}
acf(ts4)
ts4.d <- diff(ts4)
ts4.acf <- ts4.d %>% acf(20) 
ts4.pacf <- ts4.d %>% pacf(20)
ts4.acf[1]
ts4.pacf[1]
ts4.d.s <- ts4.d %>% diff(52)
ts4.sacf <- ts4.d.s %>% acf(200)
ts4.psacf <- ts4.d.s %>% pacf(200)
ts4.sacf[52] 
ts4.psacf[52]
```
Rule 1: +ac out to high lag, diff for trend
-.446 acf and pacf lag 1: add MA
From acf, max MA: 1
From pacf, max AR: 2

Rule 12:  strong and consistent seasonal pattern,  seasonal differencing. no more 2 order, 1 each or 2 on one.

sacf, -0.493 autocorrelation of the appropriately differenced series is positive at lag s 
spacf, -0.199


4. ARIMA Fit

```{r}
mse <- function(v1,v2,tsd,n){
  n1list <- round(seq(from = ceiling(n/2), to = n-1, length.out = 30))
  test.error <- numeric(length(n1list))
  for(i in 1:length(n1list)){
    n1 <- n1list[i]
    train <- tsd[1:n1]
    test <- tsd[(n1+1):n]
    train.arima <- arima(train, order = v1, 
            seasonal = list(order = v2, period = 52)) 
    test.pred <- forecast(train.arima,length(test))$mean
    test.error[i] <- sqrt(sum((test.pred-test)^2))
  }
  return(mean(test.error))
}
```

```{r, eval = F}
mse(c(2,1,1),c(0,1,1),ts4,length(ts4)) #6.58
mse(c(1,1,1),c(0,1,1),ts4,length(ts4)) #6.74
mse(c(1,1,1),c(1,1,0),ts4,length(ts4)) #error

```


5. Forecast

```{r}
model <- arima(ts4, order = c(1,1,1), seasonal = list(order = c(0,1,1), period = 52))
predict.arima <- predict(model,n.ahead= 104)
ts4.pred <- predict.arima$pred
```


```{r, eval = F}
plot(1:(length(ts4) + length(ts4.pred)), c(ts4, ts4.pred), type = 'l', col = 1)
points((length(ts4) + 1) : (length(ts4) + length(ts4.pred)), ts4.pred, type = 'l', col = 2)
```



6. Submit
```{r, eval = F}
write.table(ts4.pred,
            sep = ",",
            col.names = FALSE,
            row.names = FALSE,
            file = "Q4_Avery_Kan_25363807.txt")

```

This should save the file to your local directory. As a check to make sure it works, we can read in the file and plot the points to make sure it is what we expected.

```{r, eval = F}
temp <- read.table("Q4_Avery_Kan_25363807.txt", sep = ",")
plot(as.numeric(unlist(temp)))
```
